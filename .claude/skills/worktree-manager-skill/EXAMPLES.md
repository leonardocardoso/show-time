## MOBILE iOS EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Create iOS worktree with JIRA ticket

**User says:** "Create a worktree for PROJ-503 where I need to improve search performance"

**Your action:**
1. Detect project type: `ls *.xcodeproj` → finds iOS project
2. Extract: Feature = "Improve search performance", JIRA = "PROJ-503"
3. Use SlashCommand: `/create_mobile_worktree_prompt "Improve search performance" "PROJ-503"`

**Result:**
- Branch: `feature/PROJ-503-improve-search-performance`
- Worktree: `trees/my-app-ios-PROJ-503-improve-search-performance`
- .claude config copied

**Sample response to user:**
> I've created a worktree for improving search performance:
> - Branch: `feature/PROJ-503-improve-search-performance`
> - Location: `trees/my-app-ios-PROJ-503-improve-search-performance`
> - Open in Xcode: `cd trees/my-app-ios-PROJ-503-improve-search-performance && open *.xcworkspace`
> - Claude Code configuration ready ✓

### Example 2: Create iOS worktree without JIRA ticket

**User says:** "I need to work on splitting the Discover and Catalog code"

**Your action:**
1. Detect project type: iOS project found
2. Extract: Feature = "Split Discover and Catalog code"
3. Use SlashCommand: `/create_mobile_worktree_prompt "Split Discover and Catalog code"`

**Result:**
- Branch: `feature/split-discover-and-catalog-code`
- Worktree: `trees/my-app-ios-split-discover-and-catalog-code`

**Sample response to user:**
> I've created a worktree for splitting Discover and Catalog:
> - Branch: `feature/split-discover-and-catalog-code`
> - Location: `trees/my-app-ios-split-discover-and-catalog-code`
> - Ready to open in Xcode ✓

### Example 3: List iOS worktrees

**User says:** "What mobile worktrees do I have?"

**Your action:**
1. Use SlashCommand: `/list_worktrees_prompt`
2. Filter and highlight mobile iOS worktrees

**Sample response to user:**
> Here are your mobile iOS worktrees:
>
> 1. **feature/PROJ-503-improve-search-performance**
>    - Location: `trees/my-app-ios-PROJ-503-improve-search-performance`
>    - Project: MyApp.xcworkspace

### Example 4: Remove iOS worktree

**User says:** "Delete the search performance worktree, I've merged it"

**Your action:**
1. Identify branch: `feature/PROJ-503-improve-search-performance`
2. Use SlashCommand: `/remove_worktree_prompt feature/PROJ-503-improve-search-performance`

**Sample response to user:**
> Successfully removed the worktree:

- "set up parallel environment on [branch]"
- "make a worktree for [branch]"
- Explicit branch names

### List Keywords
- "list", "show", "display", "what", "which", "status", "check", "view"

- "Check worktree status"

### Remove Keywords
- "remove", "delete", "cleanup", "destroy", "stop", "kill", "terminate"
- "Clean up the...", "I don't need..."
- "Get rid of...", "Delete the..."
- "Remove worktree for..."
